# Memory Game

Memory game where 16 cards are displayed on a 4x4 board. When a card is clicked, it is turned around with an image displayed. Then make a second click to try and find a match. If they match, then the cards will stay flipped and change color. If they do not match, they will flip back, hiding the icon but staying in the same place. The goal of the game is to match all the cards to their partner in as few moves, and little time as possiible.

The timer will be started on your first click, and will be shown, alomg with number of moves, as you play.
